  # This sets the concurrency behavior of this plugin. By default it is :legacy, which was the standard
  # way concurrency worked before Logstash 2.4
  #
  # You should explicitly set it to either :single or :shared as :legacy will be removed in Logstash 6.0
  #
  # When configured as :single a single instance of the Output will be shared among the
  # pipeline worker threads. Access to the `#multi_receive/#multi_receive_encoded/#receive` method will be synchronized
  # i.e. only one thread will be active at a time making threadsafety much simpler.
  #
  # You can set this to :shared if your output is threadsafe. This will maximize
  # concurrency but you will need to make appropriate uses of mutexes in `#multi_receive/#receive`.
  #
  # Only the `#multi_receive/#multi_receive_encoded` methods need to actually be threadsafe, the other methods
  # will only be executed in a single thread
  # concurrency :single
  # ^ seems to frag plugin loading, "NoMethodError"
